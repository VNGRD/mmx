DO NOT GO GENTLE INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT
  QOTE 
    > 'Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
    & Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night.
    & Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
    & Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night.
    & Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
    & And you, my father, there on the sad height, Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night.
    & Rage, rage against the dying of the light.'

DO NOT STAND AT MY GRAVE AND WEEP
  QOTE 
    > 'Do not stand at my grave and weep, I am not there, I do not sleep.
    & I am in a thousand winds that blow, I am the softly falling snow.
    & I am the gentle showers of rain, I am the fields of ripening grain.
    & I am in the morning hush, I am in the graceful rush
    & Of beautiful birds in circling flight, I am the starshine of the night.
    & I am in the flowers that bloom, I am in a quiet room.
    & I am in the birds that sing, I am in each lovely thing.
    & Do not stand at my grave and cry, I am not there. I do not die.'

HABITS
  TAGS : reminder
  TYPE : note
  NOTE : bring back the habits that made you happy as a child. there’s no reason you should ever have to give up harmless things that bring you joy. you don’t have to age out of having fun. finger paint. write mediocre fanfiction and questionable poetry. put chocolate chips in your waffles. sing in the bath, and while working in the yard, and while washing your hands. hammer tunelessly on a piano. spin in circles until you fall down. climb a tree. just because you’re now in charge of your life doesn’t mean you’re expected to give up on the things that make life feel worth living
